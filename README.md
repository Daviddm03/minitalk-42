<h3>What is Minitalk ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h3>
The Minitalk project at 42 is a practical coding challenge that introduces students to inter-process communication (IPC) in Unix-based systems, specifically using signals. The objective is to create a simple messaging system with a client-server architecture where the client program can send a string message to the server program, and the server receives and displays it. This project enhances understanding of low-level system calls, signal handling, and process communication.

<h3>Key points üîë</h3>

**Signal Handling**
- Understanding how signals work, how to send them, and how to write handlers that properly interpret these signals.

**Bitwise Manipulation**
- Since the message is sent bit by bit, you‚Äôll work with bitwise operations to encode and decode characters.

**Process Communication**
- A deeper look at how processes can communicate with each other, an essential concept in Unix and Linux programming.

**System Calls** 
- Familiarizing yourself with system calls like kill() to send signals and signal() or sigaction() to handle incoming signals in the server.

<h3>Conclusion ‚úÖ</h3>
In summary, Minitalk is designed to help students understand the fundamentals of signal-based communication between processes, an essential building block for more complex systems programming tasks. It builds proficiency in working with low-level operations, teaches the basics of client-server models, and provides hands-on experience with signal handling in C.
